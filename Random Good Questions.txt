Docker - Lightweight, Fast and Simple when comes to deployment.
Platform for building, shipping and deploying our application.

Docker Core Components
1. Docker Daemon --> Docker Engine runs on host machine.
2. Docker Client --> CLI used to interact with Daemon.

Linux --> Docker Client to Docker Daemon
Windows or non linux --> Docker Client with boot2docker(Docker Host for providing a box of linux outside) --> Docker Daemon.

Docker Workflow Components

Docker Image --> (Template contains environment, application...)
Docker Container --> Created from images - Start, Stop, move, delete
Docker Registry/Docker Hub --> Public and private repositories used to store images.
DockerFiles --> Automates image construction. Docker Files has instruction to create OS, Software, installations needed etc. and build image using DockerFile.

From Docker REgistry get basic IMAGE using pull from Docker Hub, then run docker run on image gives --> Container. 
On Container add application components and create image by commiting - V1 ---Push it to Docker Repository.

Docker Repository ---pull--> Create Image --docker run-> Docker Container(+ Add Application stuff) --> Commit Docker image --Push--> Docker Repository.

Docker File does all above steps. DockerFile build create image. We can tag images as well.

Kubernette(Automate Docker Workflow) by google manages stuff like schedule, manage and deploying application components from container.
