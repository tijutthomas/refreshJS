karma - test runner (By Angular)
	Jasmine - Test Framework with Spies feature. (Spies - spy a function by another spy function)
	Mocha(Test Framework) + Sinon(Spy capability).
		With a framework like Mocha, spies are not built-in and would require pairing it with a separate library like Sinon.js
		The good news is that the switching costs between testing frameworks is relatively low with differences in syntax 
		as small as Jasmine's toEqual() and Mocha's to.equal().
