arrays.js --> 

filter() - The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
         Use Case: Find me all the items in the array that have the name "orange"
         
forEach() - The forEach() method executes a provided function once per array element.
         Use Case: Iterate through an array
 
map() - The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.
Use Case: Parse and return a array of objects that contains a additional new property, full_name
map is now my favourite method to use in javascript-heavy applications which deal with manipulation of server-sent data. 

reduce() - The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) has to reduce it to a single value.

Use Case: Parse the array and return an object that contains the number of times each string occured in the array.
